A can of rushes, straight back from the lab, has an intoxicating smell that no harddrive can ever have. Lovers of film will sing about the superlative qualities of the medium and how working with this precious material changes the creative process.

Film almost died. Hollywood became digital and Kodak was [close to the brink](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/?_r=0). Fuji [ceased cine film production](http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n130402.html) in 2013. Industry support for [celulloid filmmaking](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/22/tacita-dean-16mm-film) seemed to be declining.

I've toyed with the idea of starting a Super 8 blog for probably fifteen years, but I've also felt that the audience has been served adequately by existing resources on the web. Besides, film is dead; isn't it?

Kodak's announcement of a new camera and ongoing commitment to 8mm has reinvigorated a wider interest in Super 8. Ironically, digital filmmaking is playing a part in the format's revival. Film scans have replaced internegatives. It's easier than ever before to drop Super 8 footage onto the timeline. 

People are engaging in the format again -- perhaps more people than ever before. It's no longer a medium languishing in the past. 8mm is current!
