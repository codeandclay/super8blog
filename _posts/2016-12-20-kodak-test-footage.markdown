Kodak has released test footage from its forthcoming Super 8 camera which is due to be released in the spring.

I’m a little disappointed. Perhaps I’d set my expectations too high. The image looks sharp but the footage is noticeably unsteady. Although the camera is locked off, the frame seems to rock back and forth and there is noticeable jitter.
