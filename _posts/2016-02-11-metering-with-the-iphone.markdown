Here's a surprise. You can use your iPhone as a lightmeter. I tried out [Lux](http://www.avicora.com/lux/) today and it pretty much agreed with my Spectra. There are a number of light meter apps available; [Cine Meter II](http://adamwilt.com/cinemeterii/index.html) being the most advanced of the lot.

Cine Meter developer Adam Wilt [states](http://adamwilt.com/cinemeterii/index.html):
<blockquote>Cine Meter II is inspired by the original Cinemeter II exposure system, a digital/analog light meter designed for cinematographers by Thomas Denove and William Blowers.<br/><br/>

Cinemeter II has separate dials for ISO, FPS, and shutter angle. A row of white flip switches lets you include compensation for an 85 filter (for shooting tungsten-balanced film stock in daylight) as well as ND filters from .3 to .9. It was (and is) truly a light meter created by cinematographers for cinematographers – and they did it nearly a quarter of a century ago. Cinemeter II won Denove and Blowers a Technical Academy Award in 1990.</blockquote>  

You can even buy an attachment called [Luxi](http://www.amazon.com/Luxi-Photographic-Light-Attachment-iPhone/dp/B00GTGC5ES) that enables the phone to take incident readings. I wonder if a ping-pong ball might do the job just as effectively. 

Cinematographer Ryan E. Walters [blogged](http://www.ryanewalters.com/Blog/blog.php?id=1222011888909495377) about using the iPhone as a light meter a couple of years ago. He concludes:

<blockquote>
I am VERY impressed with where technology has come, and I appreciate people like Adam Wilt who are innovating, pushing tech forward, as well as making it more accessible, and easier to use for everyone. If you have had your eye on a light meter, but haven't had the money to get one yet, then I would recommend that you get your hands on one of these iPhone apps (if you already own an iPhone). They are a great way to start learning how to use a light meter. (By the way, I recommend paying the $4.99 for the Pocket Light Meter. Even though you can get it for free, supporting the developer is a great way to ensure its continued development and support).

Lux is available for free, whilst Cine Meter II costs £28.
