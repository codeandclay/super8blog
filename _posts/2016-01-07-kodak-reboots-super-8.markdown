The news sounds improbable, but it's true. Kodak is releasing a new consumer Super 8 camera!

To all but hardened enthusiasts, Super 8 has been dead in the water for decades. The death knell had also been ringing for Kodak itself not too long ago, but now the company is looking to reinvigorated the format with not just a new camera but a new processing service too! Could this be the rebirth of the Super 8?

Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn-AwhYOHZE">tested.com</a>, Kodak spokesperson, Josh Coon, said:

"There's an analogue renaissance. People are excited about vinyl records, craft, they're making things and there's been a resurgence in film."

"[…] Star Wars was shot on film, Jurassic World, Hateful Eight… and across the creative community there's an interest in film. So we wanted to come out with a camera that's built for the filmmakers of today."

The new camera was announced at CES 2016. It features a digital viewfinder, a crystal sync motor and records digital audio. The company also announced plans to sell cartridges process-paid. The processing costs will cover film scanning as well as development. Scans will be made in 4k resolution and will be delivered via the cloud.

No news on pricing or release dates yet. Needless to say, this blog will have plenty more to say about the announcement in the coming months.
