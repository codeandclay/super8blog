Some interesting information gleamed from Kodak's inhouse podcast, the [Kodakery](http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/corp/Podcasts/Kodakery/default.htm?CID=go&idhbx=kodakery).

The company has yet to name the forthcoming camera. The metal bodied prototype was named "The Octagon", and it is possible that they might go with that.

Also, there are plans for not just one camera but two! The "Octagon" is to be launched as a premium product whilst the rounded corner camera, already seen in Kodak's promotional material, will be launched as a lower priced model.

The are no official figures yet, but [gizmag.com](http://www.gizmag.com/kodak-super-8-movie-camera/41237/) reports that the standard model will cost between USD$400 and $700, whilst the premium model will be priced around $1,000 more.

The podcast is available on iTunes or can be listened to on Audible.
