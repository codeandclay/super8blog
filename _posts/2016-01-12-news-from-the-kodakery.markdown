Some interesting information gleamed from Kodak's in-house podcast, [The Kodakery](http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/corp/Podcasts/Kodakery/default.htm?CID=go&idhbx=kodakery).

Firstly, the company is yet to name its forthcoming Super 8 camera. The metal bodied prototype was dubbed "The Octagon", and it is possible that they might go with that.

Also, there are plans for not just one camera but two! The "Octagon" is to be launched as a premium product whilst the rounded corner camera, seen in Kodak's promotional material, will be launched as a lower priced model.

The are no official figures yet, but [gizmag.com](http://www.gizmag.com/kodak-super-8-movie-camera/41237/) reports that the standard model will cost between USD$400 and $700, whilst the premium model will be priced around $1,000 more.

There's also mention that a Chinese company is marketing a Super 8 film scanner. That's extremely interesting news if true!

The podcast is available on iTunes or can be listened to on Audible.
