Kodak is planning to bring back Ektachrome.

The company's lineup has been missing a reversal filmstock in recent years and this exciting news demonstrates that Kodak hasn't lost its dedication to film.

Kodak will manufacture the stock in 35mm and Super 8 formats. It is expected to become available towards the end of 2017.
