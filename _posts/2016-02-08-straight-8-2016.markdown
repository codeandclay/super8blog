After a four year hiatus -- the last competition took place in 2012 -- Straight 8 is back.

The concept is simple. Cartridges are mailed out to entrants who then shoot whatever they choose. Entrants also provide a soundtrack. Straight 8 then develops the film, scans it and syncs the soundtrack to the first frame. There is no editing -- only in camera -- and there are no viewings until the screening night.

*Biskremosis -- Marc Holtbecker, Robert Neumann, Annette Schneider, Caro Stoeckermann, and Andre Wlodrski -- was an entry is the last competition.*

To see what else you might be up against, here's a taster from 2012:
