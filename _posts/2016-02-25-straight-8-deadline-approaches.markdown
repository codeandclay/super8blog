There's not long left to register for this year's [*straight 8*](http://www.straight8.net/). Once registered, entrants will be sent a Super 8 cart on which to shoot their film. The deadline for submissions is April 4th. Winners will see their films premiered at Cannes.

The competition attracts filmmakers from all over the globe. A [map](http://www.straight8.net/straight8ers/) on the *straight 8* website shows entrants past and present.
