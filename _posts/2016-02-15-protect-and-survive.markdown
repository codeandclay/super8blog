Chris Gavin's films contain strong graphical elements. In his 8mm work, the film itself is often used as a visual motif.

He shoots anamorphically but does not limit himself to the edges of the screen. Using a homemade scanner, he overscans his frames to reveal sprocket holes and a dirt rimmed gate.

In *Wall of Death* he presents strips of sequential frames that, together with a rumbling sound track, mimic the frenetic display of the gravity defying motorcycles.

*The Secret Nuclear Bunker* evokes [Protect and Survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFOX6HPr24), a public information campaign from Cold War Britain. But the [caffenol]({% post_url 2016-02-01-making-coffee-soup %}) soaked footage suggests a world where the bombs have already dropped.
